# Flick Pick

Do you find yourself consistently spending significant periods of time trying to find a movie to watch? Well, this app was designed with you in mind. This app removes the periods of indecision in your life by picking a movie for you to watch based on a list you create within the app. As well, Flick Pick features a randomizer that will also randomize a movie from a specific genre for the users feeling bold, or for those unable to even create a list of movies (I know you are out there).

Flick Pick was designed and created as a side project by myself and two other classmates Eugene Yu and Devashish Shresthra while attending a full time web development bootcamp. It was aimed at learning how to work with API's and React. 

My main role within this project was to create the randomizer that chose a movie from genres and years selected by the user. Since the [The Movie Database's](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) only provides users of their api access to one page which only includes 20 movies at a time I had to make two separate GET requests. One request was used to get a random page from their database, and the second request was to get a random movie from their API.  

## This application was built using:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en)
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
